INTENDED ACHIEVEMENTS

~ FUNDAMENTALS ~		500 points

Scale (100):
Established scale by comparing a human-sized player towards cats, the environments, and trees. 
One kitten is also smaller relative to other cats. Objects are also small compared to the height of tree trunks.

Animation (100):
A key and chest lid are animated.

Lighting (100):
There is both real-time (so that shadows of grabbable objects move accordingly when picked up) as well as baked lighting.

Locomotion (100):
The player can move around via teleport, while unable to reach the very edge of the island.
I wanted to use simple walking, and possibly running (with footstep sounds), but Teleporting seems to be so much more common and easier to grasp for players, so I went with that.

Physics (100):
Leaves fall and simulate gravity with drag. I wanted them to float left and right (more like a proper leaf) but couldn't figure out a not-difficult and inexpensive way to do it.
Objectives can be thrown and are affected by gravity. Chest can be moved with the the mass of thrown coconuts. Fish are affected by gravity and forces and wiggle properly.  Tree trunks do not move and objects are affected by their sturdiness. Mass differences between objects cause more natural collisions.



~ COMPLETENESS ~			500 (750?) points

Gamification (250):
There's an achievements system. Really nothing more to say here.

Diagetic UI (250?):
This was an intended achievement but I'm not sure if I hit this one correctly.
Ideally, what I'm going for is giving zero explanations at all, and the player being able to figure out everything on their own using controls testing and reading the situation.
User testing showed no explanations or help from me was ever needed and everything was clear enough, but I'm not 100% certain that the situation/controls/goals are that clear to anyone. 
I'd especially like some feedback on if everything really does seem clear.

AI Achievement (250):
Simple AI scripts allow Kittens to wander around, all in seemingly pseudo-random directions. 
They do cat things when they get bored. The Little Kitten behaves differently and seeks shade.
As the time to reach their destinations usually differs, they aren't all doing the same things in unison at the same time.



~ CHALLENGES ~

Speech Recognition (500):
While pretty stupid, you can scream at the sun. Because of course you can.

I wanted to do User Testing here instead, but it is only worth 500 points if I have 750 in Completeness, and I'm not entirely sure I do.
